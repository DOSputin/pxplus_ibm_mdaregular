A webfontpack - [PXPlus IBM Monochrome Display Adapter](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/#ibmmda) character font 

[IBM MDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Monochrome_Display_Adapter) graphics cards text mode used a 9x14 text cell and were strictly limited to the 256 characters contained in the Character Generator EPROM on the display adapter. 
This 14-scanline MDA font's characters are stored 8 pixels wide, but displayed with an additional 9th column (either blank or a duplicate of the 8th, depending on the character).  MDA only had a single, 80-column text mode.  The same font was used on the Hercules Graphics Card and a host of other clones.
